CardioTime: Predictive Analysis of Cardiac Arrest Using Time Series Data
CardioTime is a predictive analytics project aimed at early detection and prevention of cardiac arrest events using machine learning techniques. By analyzing time-series data such as heart rate, blood pressure, and other vital signs, the project seeks to identify patterns that may signal impending cardiac distress. The model leverages historical data and sophisticated algorithms to provide accurate predictions, empowering healthcare providers with valuable insights for timely intervention.

The project employs Python for data processing, feature extraction, and model training, with tools like pandas, NumPy, and machine learning frameworks. Visualizations and insights are generated to enhance understanding and decision-making.
